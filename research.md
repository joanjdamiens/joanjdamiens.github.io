## Manuscripts under review / in preparation
Damiens, J., Berger, M., Junna, L., Martikainen, P., Mortgage affordability and mental healthcare use: Evidence from Finnish population registers. 
Affiliations: University of Helsinki, Medical University of Vienna
Dual event-study and mixed-model design to show that the mental health impact of mortgages depends on repayment affordability at onset, with high-burden borrowers experiencing increased risks and tenants consistently disadvantaged. Status: Under review (Revise and Resubmit). In: Social Science & Medicine.

Cisotto, E., Moretti, M., Silan, M., Damiens, J., Belloni, P., Korhonen, K., Martikainen, P. Mapping Social Health and Dementia Risk: A Register-Based Study of Older Adults in Finland.
Affiliations: Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Bocconi University, University of Padua, University of Helsinki. 
This study examines the influence of individual- and area-level social health factors on geographic variation in dementia incidence among older adults in Finland, employing a matching-based method (MARMoT). Status: Under review. In: Social Science & Medicine.

Damiens, J., Bishop, L., Martikainen, P. Siblings' health trajectories: a dynamic study of the role of family, work and geography. 
Affiliations: University of Helsinki
This study investigates whether divergence in family, work, and geographic trajectories predicts discordance in health outcomes among Finnish siblings, using sequence analysis and sibling fixed-effects linear probability models. 
Status: manuscript ready, last modifications. Target: Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 

Damiens, J., Gotink, J., Tarkiainen, L., Gadeyne, S., Martikainen, P. Decomposing and understanding the suicide trends: a comparative analysis of Belgium and Finland.
Affiliations: University of Helsinki, Brussels Institute for Social and Population Studies
I led a cross-national demographic study of Belgium and Finland that decomposed suicide mortality declines into behavioural risk reductions vs. compositional shifts (ageing, educational expansion) by sex and age, and triangulated findings with negative binomial models to pinpoint policy-relevant drivers, especially among low-educated mid-life men.
Status: Manuscript in preparation. Target: Demography.

Damiens, J. Housing affordability, family trajectories and mental health: Evidence from Finnish Registers
Using Finnish registers, I model joint housing-family trajectories (tenure and flow-based mortgage burden; partnership/parenthood) with multi-channel sequence analysis, milestone-anchored event studies, and within-person/sibling fixed effects to identify how order and instability drive mental health risks, yielding policy-relevant evidence beyond static status comparisons. 
Status: Manuscript in preparation. Target: Demography.

Berger M., Damiens, J., Junna, L., Martikainen, P. Buy or rent? Mental health risk trade-offs from involuntary job loss between homeownership and mortgage debt 
Affiliations: University of Helsinki, Medical University of Vienna
This project employs a quasi-causal event study design to investigate whether debt temporarily offsets the protective effect of homeownership on mental health in the context of job loss.
 Status: Manuscript in preparation. Target: Journal of Health Economics 

Damiens, J., Dudel, C. Mental Health Life Expectancy from Multistate Models: Incidence, Recovery, Relapse, and Suicide in the Population.
Affiliations: University of Helsinki, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research 
Through multistate life tables for mental health trajectories and dynamic prediction of state occupancy and transitions to suicide, this framework yields interpretable hazard ratios and policy-relevant absolute measures, clarifies when suicide risk is elevated (during treatment vs post-cessation), and quantifies which transitions drive socioeconomic and partnership disparities in time on treatment and suicide risk. 
Status: Manuscript in preparation. Target: Demography.

Dei Bardi, L., Damiens, J., Berger, M., Tarkiainen, L., Martikainen, P.  Housing Wealth, Mortality and Mental Healthcare Use in Finland
Affiliations: University of Helsinki, Medical University of Vienna
This project examines how individual and parental housing wealth influence mental health trajectories, utilising Finnish register data to distinguish the direct effects of housing assets from intergenerational transfers and resources. Status: Analyses ongoing. Target: Housing Studies. 


## Ongoing projects
SdeCare project: Healthcare trajectories of the populations dead due to suicide in Belgium. 
Collaboration between UCLouvain (Pr. Christine Schnor, Dr. Joan Damiens) and Mutualité Chrétienne (Dr. Svetlana Sholokhova, Dr. Stijn Vos)
This project aims at studying the healthcare trajectories of the population who died by suicide and deaths of despair in Belgium, thanks to sequence analyses, through the data of the Mutualité chrétienne. 
Status: The data request has been approved by Statbel in October 2025.  

Parenthood, Policy, and Gendered Inequalities: A Finland-Australia Comparative Study
Collaboration between the University of Queensland (Dr. Mengxuan Suri Li, Pr. Janeen Baxter) and the University of Helsinki (Dr. Olivia McEvoy, Dr. Joan Damiens)
Using aligned linked administrative data from Finland and Australia, this project examines how the transition to parenthood and family size shape long-term gender income gaps and mothers’ mental health and suicide mortality, leveraging policy contrasts (leave design and sharing) to identify life-course effects and inform equity-focused welfare reforms.
Status: An application for funding at the University of Helsinki (FIRE program) has been submitted; the data request for Australian data is in preparation.
