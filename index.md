# Joan Damiens, PhD

I am a demographer working at the intersection of social studies, family demography, and public health. I study inequalities in physical conditions, mental health, and mortality, with inter- and intragenerational perspectives. My work combines sociological and psychological theory with longitudinal methods (event-study, event-history, multistate, and decomposition approaches).

**Current position:** Postdoctoral researcher, Helsinki Institute for Demography and Population Health (University of Helsinki) — within the Max Planck–University of Helsinki Centre for Social Inequalities in Population Health.
